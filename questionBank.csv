5,What's the negative influence when there is Collinearity Problem? ,four,Choices,Make stronger power for your model,No bad influence,Inflate the variance of at least one estimated regression coefficient,Smaller the P-value,,C
6,What's the relationship between VIF scores with Collinearity Problem?,four,Choices,A VIF between 5 and 10 indicates high correlation that may be problematic. ,They don't have any relationship,"VIF smaller than 5, you can assume that the regression coefficients are poorly estimated due to multico",I don't know,,A
7,Is collinearity must be remove?,four,Choices,"Yes, we must solved collinearity problem","Not really, when the overall test that all indicators have coefficients of zero is unaffected by the high VIFs. And nothing else in the regression is affected.",,,,B
